		<h1>How to Build a Space Elevator: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This text is intended for those who are firmly determined to undertake the construction of a space elevator and plan to do so within a foreseeable timeframe, relying on technologies already existing and tested on Earth. It does not contain detailed blueprints but rather a list of technical specifications and a brief description of various operating modes, materials, energy consumption, obvious questions of dynamics, safety, and control, as well as calculations demonstrating the behavior of this system under different conditions.</p>

                <h2>The Space Elevator: Theory</h2>
                <p>Traditionally, all books and articles devoted to the topic of the space elevator mention the pioneers of the idea—Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who formulated it in 1895; Soviet engineer Yuri Artsutanov, who developed it further in 1960; and American science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote the book <i>The Fountains of Paradise</i> (1979). Additionally, it’s worth mentioning Carl Evans Bradley, who worked on the space elevator problem at NASA around the turn of the millennium. His efforts led to numerous competitions for the strongest fiber for the elevator and lifting mechanisms, which helped systematize materials on this topic. Currently, the Japanese company Obayashi is working on this challenge, promising such an elevator by 2050.</p>
                <p>All these ideas aimed to create an elevator that, for simplicity, we will call a "classic" or "stationary" one. That is, a cable made of yet-to-be-developed materials (likely carbon nanotubes or diamond threads) stretching from 35,000 to 144,000 kilometers (the distance varies in different concepts). Carbon nanotubes and graphene already exist and theoretically possess the required strength, but due to manufacturing defects, it has not yet been possible to produce a thread of the necessary strength longer than tens of centimeters. Moreover, their price hovers around $10 per gram—and this is not for threads but for raw material, most often used as a conductor in energy applications. This high cost is not due to the rarity of the chemical element but to the stringent requirements of the production process, purity, and energy demands of such manufacturing.</p>
                <p>Additionally, as even proponents of this concept acknowledge, the cable would suffer from winds, micrometeorites, lightning, and a host of other issues, requiring regular repairs—essentially replicating the production process of this thread not in factory conditions but in the field.</p>
                <p>There is another consideration: even if we had materials of the necessary strength and solved the problem of lifting this cable 35,000 or 144,000 kilometers, we wouldn’t be able to build it on Mercury (due to its slow rotation and the tidal forces of the Sun). If Venus had an Earth-like atmosphere, we couldn’t implement this idea there due to the planet’s slow rotation. It couldn’t be built on Mars either, because of its moons, Phobos and Deimos. Theoretically, such a structure could be built on the Moon—not due to the Moon’s centrifugal force but due to Earth’s gravity, with a counterweight positioned between them. Perhaps it will appear there, or perhaps on Earth, and we can only wish the developers luck, as it’s a simple and elegant solution. However, the paradox lies in this: the classic orbital elevator does not solve the problem of landing on any planet in the Solar System. At the destination, one would have to revert to rocket propulsion again, delivering or producing fuel there, and so on. Thus, the idea of a classic, Earth-based, stationary elevator is a specific case. If the statistical distribution of the Solar System tells us anything, such an elevator cannot be a universal solution for terrestrial planets. Fortunately, there is an alternative path, and it is achievable with today’s level of Earth’s technologies.</p>
                <p>The proposed low-orbit elevator somewhat resembles the idea of an orbital bridge but only vaguely, without physical connections to the surface, without equatorial supports, and not spanning the entire length of the planet.</p>

                <h2>The Low-Orbit Elevator: Structure</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The low-orbit elevator is a space station of enormous length (4,600 km for Earth) and gigantic scale by the standards of modern space programs. For other bodies in the Solar System, it would be orders of magnitude shorter. The vast majority of its mass consists of lightweight and simple metallic structures, manufactured to a single design and interchangeable, which are not overly complex to produce. Their primary task is to serve as a support for a small cart—or, as we also call it, a trolley—that moves along a magnetic levitation (maglev) track. The outer side of this tunnel is used for temporary storage and movement of cargo and the placement of additional equipment, covered from above with an aerodynamic shell that reduces drag from residual atmosphere. A narrow, continuous slot runs along the "floor" of the tunnel throughout the station’s length, sealed from external influences when not in use. This is a fairly general description, but to understand it well, focus on this: a maglev tunnel made up of individual segments that can move longitudinally relative to each other or flex at a slight angle, with a slot in the floor.</p>

                <h3>Blocks</h3>
                <p>Since the station is stretched along Earth’s circular orbit and because it experiences enormous longitudinal loads, it consists of separate blocks. For simplicity, we assume that the length of such a block is 200 meters (and we will only refer to this length going forward), although shorter blocks exist at the beginning and end of the station. Each block is connected at its ends to its neighbor by six (or eight) dampers—two at the bottom, one (or two) on the left, one (or two) on the right, and two at the top—extending up to 50 meters from each block. These dampers move longitudinally in their slots, allowing the blocks to be spaced from 0 to 100 meters apart. We will explain how this works and why it’s necessary below. (See Appendix 1: "Trusses" for details.)</p>
                <p>Additionally, each block is equipped with four groups of gyroscopes controlled by electric motors/generators (see Appendix 2: "Gyroscopes" for more details), which are responsible for the block’s positioning and also serve as storage for electrical energy.</p>

                <h3>The Cart</h3>
                <p>The key element of the orbital elevator is the cart, which contains a cargo capsule cradle and the capsule itself (8 tons), a powerful electric winch (6 tons—likely less in practice—300 MW), and a spool of Dyneema SK99 cable in a vacuum-sealed, thermally protected sleeve. Alternatives to this cable could include heat-resistant Zylon, carbon fiber T1100, or some material based on CNT tapes—all of which are already produced today, and there is every reason to hope that more candidates meeting these requirements will emerge in the near future. Such a 100-km spool of cable weighs 7 tons. Additionally, the cart contains a cryogenic system, refilled before launch, which ensures 10 minutes of operation for the motor and capsule magnets in a vacuum under superconducting conditions. The total weight of the cart with cargo is estimated at 20 tons.</p>

                <h3>Station Materials</h3>
                <p>Three main materials are considered for the station’s construction: steel, aluminum, and titanium, due to the ease of their extraction, processing, and transportation. However, steel is ruled out for most purposes right away: firstly, it loses ductility at low temperatures; secondly, it tends to retain residual magnetization, which would significantly interfere with precise maglev control. Aluminum, or rather its alloys, is the primary candidate at this stage of calculations for nearly everything: structures, since cold does not significantly affect its strength characteristics; and use in electric motor coils, as it is lightweight and preferable to copper at low temperatures. However, this is a matter for detailed technical design. Titanium is used in alloys with aluminum, possibly in critical nodal connections.</p>
                <p>At the preliminary calculation stage, it is assumed that each 200-meter block must be capable of withstanding the longitudinal load associated with accelerating a 20-ton cart at 10g.</p>

                <h2>Environmental and Operating Conditions</h2>
                <p>It is assumed that the station operates at an altitude of 100 km (pressure 0.0001–0.0003 Pa). At this altitude, the residual atmospheric density is still critically high, so this is taken as the baseline design altitude with the possibility of adjustment upward. For example, at 110 km (0.00003–0.0001 Pa) or 120 km (0.00001–0.00003 Pa), and so on.</p>
                <p>During solar coronal mass ejections, the density increases significantly. The baseline altitude of 100 km is chosen because calculations suggest the station can function at this height, albeit with significant costs and a certain level of risk. The basis for this assertion lies in the fact that the station has a very small frontal projection relative to its mass, lacks protruding elements, has aerodynamic contours, and its side walls are covered with polished metal and a coating that enhances slipperiness.</p>
                <p>Due to the low pressure, temperature is determined solely by radiation, and our goal is to minimize the temperature inside the station as much as possible. Therefore, the surfaces facing Earth and the Sun (when it is at zenith) are made of light-reflecting materials, while the side surfaces, shaded from solar or Earth’s infrared radiation, are heat-radiating, with heat dissipated to them via passive systems. Through this approach, we aim to achieve an internal temperature of 100–120 Kelvin.</p>
                <p>A key and inevitable debate that will arise regarding the feasibility of such a station is whether it can even operate at such a low orbit. All experience in the aerospace industry casts doubt on this. Appendix 3: "Compensation" provides calculations confirming the possibility of this scenario. In any case, there is always the option to increase the orbit’s altitude as long as it remains practical, because each additional kilometer of altitude lengthens the station. Regardless, this system can function around low-atmosphere bodies—the Moon, Mercury, Mars.</p>

                <h2>Lifting Technology from the Planet</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Step 1.</b> At the beginning of the tunnel (the nose of the station, the point that first passes any orbital point), using magnetic accelerators in the tunnel, while in weightlessness and held in the center of the tunnel, the cart begins accelerating at 5g. The target speed is 7.3 km/s (orbital velocity minus Earth’s rotation speed). The cart will reach this speed after 572.7 kilometers, and this acceleration will take 2 minutes and 18 seconds.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 2.</b> The cart has accelerated to 7.3 km/s, moving relative to the station but stationary relative to Earth’s surface. From it, with free-fall acceleration and an initial speed of 0 (acceleration could be added to the capsule in any way, but 8 tons is a significant inertial mass), a cargo container is sent downward, unspooling the cable behind it. This cable, via an electric motor, slows the descent, maintaining a speed such that the container’s outer shell does not heat above 500 degrees Celsius (any temperature can be set, but this affects descent speed). At the end of the descent, with an overload of 1 or 2g, the container brakes and hovers stationary at an altitude of about 10–12 km. This entire descent takes about 3–4 minutes. There, slightly above the altitude of civil aviation, it is met by a specialized airship, which replaces the container within seconds (up to a minute). With communication between the station and airship, knowledge of wind directions, precise geopositioning of all devices, the presence of maneuvering thrusters on the container (both jet and aerodynamic if necessary), computer navigation, beacons, lidars, and the ability to control the cable length—this is a solvable task. See Appendix 6: "Drift" for details.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 3.</b> The new cargo is lifted by the winch at a speed safe for the cable, likely with a constant acceleration of 1–2g. A few kilometers before reaching the station, the winch provides almost no lifting force, and the container rises by inertia, losing speed under the station and being pulled into and secured in the capsule’s cradle. During the descent, ascent, and airship overload period, the cart travels 3,300–3,500 kilometers along the station. The current speed limit of 500 m/s is due to a technological barrier related to the cable’s elasticity and overheating, and the fact that only a climb that differs from the speed of sound by at least 30% is energetically favorable due to the wave crisis.

 It is highly likely that this will be resolved.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 4.</b> After the cargo container is automatically loaded and secured in the cradle, the cart decelerates with the same 5g overload over the same duration. Unloading occurs, and the cargo is either sent to a higher orbit or stored on the station. The cart returns to the station’s head via a service tunnel, without such overloads, undergoes inspection, maintenance, and awaits its next turn.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It’s important to understand that when the cargo accelerates, we expend a significant amount of electrical energy (the power consumption is about 4 GW, expended over 3 minutes). However, when the cart with cargo stops at the end of its path, we can recover this energy and use it for the next launch. Given the vacuum and low temperatures in the tunnel, the recuperation coefficient is expected to be quite high.</p>

                <h2>Dynamic Processes</h2>
                <p>Accelerating cargo in space differs from a similar process on Earth. There, maglev tubes rest on concrete supports embedded in the ground—an enormous mass—so all movements are dampened and affect the system with vibrations. There is also the flip side: in terrestrial conditions, the main challenges are maintaining a vacuum and the propagation of vibrations through the tunnel walls and the ground (foundation). In space, we don’t face either of these issues, and all dynamic vibrations are damped by shock absorbers, gyroscopes, and the mass of the block itself, which interacts with the payload for approximately 0.02 seconds.

. In a vacuum, accelerating a 20-ton cart results in an equal and opposite acceleration of the rails, magnetic coils, and tunnel it moves through.</p>
                <p>In our tunnel, there are three stages of the journey: the cart’s acceleration, its movement at a speed of 7.3 km/s (when cargo is lowered/raised from Earth), and its braking. Given the cart’s 20-ton mass, with rigid block connections, the cumulative impulses from acceleration and braking would tear the station apart.</p>
                <p>The solution lies in the design feature: each block has six or eight electromagnetic dampers at each end, which can extend up to 100 meters (this length will decrease during detailed design) and provide braking with energy recuperation at 5g acceleration. Moreover, since they use an electromagnetic principle for damping, they can easily serve as external maglev rails for the cart and act as actuators to align and pull blocks relative to each other. They cannot accelerate the cart due to their low mass but are capable of maintaining its course. This is a fairly heavy system, with a mass of 6.6 tons on one side of a block.</p>
                <p>The purpose of such recuperation is to convert 90% of the block’s kinetic energy back into electricity and reduce the speed at which the blocks drift apart. At the end of the journey (braking), the situation is similar but has its own specifics. See Appendix 4: "Dampers" for details.</p>
                <p>Thus, after a cargo descent-ascent cycle from Earth, the station is stretched, like an accordion. The damper-actuators can controllably contract with energy expenditure, pulling the blocks back into place, or ensure the maglev track returns to a sufficiently straight state for the next launch, assisted by gyroscopes and gyrodynes installed in each block.</p>
                <p>Additionally, over an extended period, the cart with cargo suspended on the cable effectively hangs stationary above Earth, levitating on the blocks, each of which it passes in 0.027 seconds. In doing so, it alters the orbital speed of each block, but so insignificantly that it would only affect the orbit if no corrections were made. See Appendix 5: "Orbit" for details.</p>
                <p>If the disturbances after the cart’s passage are not too significant, we can move to the second use case for the station.</p>

                <h2>Interplanetary Launch</h2>
                <p>If the station is in a "compressed" state, meaning all blocks are 0 meters apart, its use for launching poses no difficulty at all: the cargo (not the cart, as there’s no point in launching it) is accelerated so that each block imparts an equal impulse to it. Each block is pushed back against the cart’s motion, caught up by the next one, the station’s speed changes slightly, and the structure remains intact.</p>
                <p>If the station is in a "stretched" state after lifting cargo, aligned by gyrodynes and actuators, we can launch the cargo from one of two loading windows—either at the start of the braking zone or the end of the acceleration zone. If it’s the end of the acceleration zone, the cargo is directed toward the station’s tail and launched so that, as it passes each block, it imparts an acceleration that increases the block’s orbital speed and begins "folding" the dampers. Since there are 3,360 km of travel ahead, previously used for lifting, and 572.2 km (physically more, but for acceleration, we use only the length of the blocks, not the dampers) of braking distance, even at 5g, a speed of 19.73 meters per second is achieved. The speed could be increased, but at low altitudes, this would actively heat the frontal fairing and cause ablation.</p>
                <p>What this means:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The 7.8 km/s of Earth’s orbital velocity is compensated.</li>
                    <li>The cargo, moving in the opposite direction from the station, gains 11.93 km/s, which exceeds the 11.2 km/s needed to escape Earth’s orbit and head toward Mars, the Moon, Mercury, asteroids, or any other point in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>The station receives a longitudinal and distributed impulse that compensates for the speed loss described in Appendix 5: "Orbit" and Appendix 3: "Compensation."</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The ability to launch at a speed of 20 km/s (or higher) and maintain the cargo at that speed in the tunnel is a key challenge for the low-orbit elevator under Earth’s conditions. The station can operate without reaching these speeds, but such a launch resolves a whole range of issues. It’s worth noting that the pressure inside the station’s tunnel, enclosed at the front and sides, is lower than outside the station.</p>
                <p>When launching at a low speed of up to 1 km/s in the direction of the station’s motion, the cargo will enter an elliptical orbit at an altitude of, say, 200–400 km, where it can be intercepted or stabilized by engines.</p>
                <p>When launching at 7.8 km/s against the station’s motion, the cargo will hover stationary relative to Earth and then fall. If it’s sturdy—say, a cubic meter of platinum from asteroids in a steel jacket, dropped over a lifeless desert—it will, of course, sustain damage and create a 50-meter crater in the sand, but there will be no fiery tail, and its temperature will quickly stabilize (within minutes).</p>

                <h2>Control</h2>
                <p>The station’s mass is on the order of half a million tons. Obviously, it can be corrected with engines, but the cost would be enormous. However, its flight can be controlled using gyroscopes installed on the blocks, a system of electronic actuators and stabilizers, and constant longitudinal impulses that alter the station’s orbital speed, which can be applied at apogee, perigee, or another calculated point. The station might have a few engines for local emergency corrections if necessary, capable of moving along its length. This is a topic for separate modeling. The station does not need classic engines to maintain its orbit, as every external cargo launch is a launch of reaction mass accelerated by all the station’s segments.</p>

                <h1>Construction</h1>

                <h2>Construction Challenges</h2>
                <p>Obviously, lifting such a mass into orbit from Earth is impossible. But this weight is primarily not high-precision instruments but metal structures that will serve as supports for cargo in the maglev system, gyroscope-accumulators, magnets, and coils. In other words, 99% of the mass is not delicate electronics. It is proposed to establish their production on the Moon.</p>
                <p>Today, this may seem impossible, but such a project could transform our satellite into a robotic base capable of meeting many of our planet’s needs for space structures. Someone might say that delivering these items from the Moon would be too expensive—and they would be mistaken.</p>
                <p>One feature of the Moon comes to our aid: since it is tidally locked with Earth, it always faces our planet with the same side and, therefore, aligns with the Earth orbit of interest. A maglev built on the lunar surface (actually covered by a tunnel to avoid regolith contamination), directed toward Earth, would launch cargo toward Earth with each activation, achieving reasonably high precision. This opens up a vast array of possibilities, limited only by the technological level of lunar production, and an orbital elevator around Earth is just one of them.</p>
                <p>To send fragments of this station—whose construction materials can all be sourced from the Moon—into Earth’s orbit, a launch velocity of about 3 km/s is required, accounting for overcoming lunar gravity. Depending on the acceleration forces applied to these cargos (and others), a tunnel approximately 46 kilometers long would be needed for launches at 10g.</p>
                <p>This is far from a fantastical structure, considering that both the materials for its construction and even the materials for producing machines and robots can be found on the Moon. Yes, they may look worse, their engines may be weaker, and they may fail more often. But that won’t matter.</p>

                <h2>Lunar Expedition Elevator</h2>
                <p>Clearly, before constructing such a major structure as an elevator in Earth’s orbit, numerous technical questions must be addressed. A similar structure around the Moon can assist with this.</p>
                <p>Here, the orbit is again extremely low, as permitted by lunar gravitational anomalies. Consider an orbit at 20 km, possibly elliptical, with a perigee at 20 km. An elliptical orbit around the Moon is advantageous because it allows a cart to adjust its speed to match incoming cargo arriving from varying orbital heights, receiving them onboard and then unloading them onto the lunar surface. Since the existence of such a station in lunar orbit implies the presence of a magnetic catapult, we can assume that one of the products of lunar industry would be a simplified, single-use cart.</p>
                <p>This cart carries a cargo container, which it releases from a height of 20 km above a designated surface point, along with a spool of cable on a drum with a brake to control the container’s descent speed before landing. Acceleration to orbital velocity would require up to 30 km at 5g, with descent and braking taking about 2 minutes and covering 282 km along the station. Thus, in its minimal configuration, the station would be 300 km long—sufficient to land any required volume of cargo without fuel expenditure.</p>
                <p>As for the lunar maglev, it will aid in testing physical principles, enable the next step in developing vacuum magnetic levitation and acceleration technologies, and, in any case, prove cost-effective for constructing orbital structures around Earth.</p>

                <h2>Additional Considerations Relevant to the Station Project</h2>
                <h3>Sensors and Sensory Systems</h3>
                <p>Controlling maglev movement requires a multitude of sensors and sensory systems. These are also essential for precisely analyzing the relative positions of blocks. They cannot be manufactured on the Moon. However, they are not needed for the initial arrival in Earth’s orbit and assembly; they can be integrated later.</p>
                <p>Regarding the required precision, I believe that with such block lengths and associated tolerances, accuracy to the millimeter will suffice.</p>

                <h3>Energy Balance</h3>
                <p>Accelerations and launches are powered by energy stored in gyroscopes. The station has no other energy sources. How is this energy "pumped" into the station, and where does it come from? I think the most reasonable approach is transmission from solar panels on station. Several obvious methods exist for this—such as laser or microwave transmission. Promising solutions are also emerging, but they are beyond the scope of this document. It suffices that energy transmission methods exist and are accessible with today’s technological level.</p>

                <h3>Failures, Repairs, and Maintenance</h3>
                <p>An obvious drawback of this station is the inability to place it in a hangar for repairs. All maintenance work is conducted internally. Each block, in addition to the main and transport tunnels, includes a space equal in shape and volume to them. This volume may be reduced during final design. It is partly used to house gyroscopes, but ample space remains for storing reserve reaction mass, cargo, spare components, and specialized modules. This area serves as the primary space from which station repair work is conducted, which boils down to diagnostics and component replacement.</p>
                <p>Key components subject to replacement include hull sheets damaged by micrometeorites, gyroscopes, dampers, coils, and electronic units.</p>
                <p>An obvious question arises: with 20,000 blocks, if one is constantly malfunctioning, will it halt the entire chain and station operations? Calculations suggest otherwise. The most critical failures are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Gyroscope failure due to jamming</b> (e.g., micrometeorite impact). The stored momentum would instantly shift the block. This can be mitigated by other gyroscopes, including those on adjacent blocks—a solvable engineering challenge.</li>
                    <li><b>Maglev coil failure in a block.</b> The most significant impact would occur on the constant-speed track, where the cart, weighing 20 tons, spends 0.02 seconds in a block. Over 200 meters, it would drop by 3.5 millimeters, which can be compensated in subsequent blocks. Additionally, in the compressed state, these blocks contain 2×50 meters of dampers with their own coils, which may remain operational.</li>
                    <li><b>Electrical wiring failure</b> does not lead to noticeable problems, as the station has energy storage capacity along its entire length. Control signals and units are redundantly duplicated, including via wireless and laser methods (lasers being a key tool for block positioning control).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The station’s maintenance logic is built on the premise that some blocks in the chain may be non-functional without halting launches. Failed blocks are dismantled and used as reaction mass. New blocks, containing spare components, are attached to the station’s tail. All station maintenance is reduced to standardized robotic mounting/dismounting operations performed by complexes evenly distributed along the station’s length and capable of moving along it.</p>

                <h3>Safety</h3>
                <p>The orbital stability of a station weighing hundreds of thousands of tons, with a frontal area of 50 square meters, even at an altitude of 100+ km, should be considered high, provided sufficient energy and reaction mass are available. Nevertheless, the consequences of potential accidents must be evaluated:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Cargo collision with the station at maximum speed in the tunnel.</b> For obvious reasons, this would always occur at an acute angle, resulting in the vaporization of the cargo and significant lateral disturbances to the station (most likely causing block rotation and deviation from the movement axis). In this scenario, several kilometers of the tunnel would be lost. Emergency block decoupling mechanisms would activate, allowing the remaining part of the station to continue orbiting. The two parts of the station could then reconnect and resume operations. Small debris, dispersing at speeds below 7.8 km/s in the residual atmosphere, would fall relatively quickly.</li>
                    <li><b>Fall of station parts into the atmosphere.</b> A block is a metal structure with very low density, as there is no need to maintain an atmosphere or temperature—it’s essentially a large truss. Its mass may increase during design, but even then, it will remain relatively low. Moreover, the station is almost entirely made of aluminum alloys, which would simply vaporize upon uncontrolled atmospheric entry. It contains no radioactive materials, as we deliberately avoid power supply from modular reactors, leading to the final verdict—it is safe.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Economic Considerations and Risks</h3>
                <p>An accurate assessment of the economic impact of such a station is a matter for a separate, comprehensive analysis. This is a realm of assumptions based on how many launches we can perform per orbit (90 minutes). Launches and lifts may be unsafe over the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean due to gravitational disturbances. It’s impossible to say what the inter-launch interval will be. If there is no interval at all—meaning a lift/descent immediately follows an interplanetary launch and vice versa—this yields approximately 3.91 launches per Earth orbit. If the cargo is then independently sent to higher orbits, the number of lifts could increase. The described system gives us about 200,000 tons of cargo per year, but this requires further calculations.</p>
                <p>Building such a structure around Earth raises many questions. One of them: several private and governmental organizations are currently working on a classic elevator. What if they succeed—what then to do with this massive, obviously expensive station? If this happens, it would be a tremendous breakthrough for humanity and would increase the station’s profitability. While a classic elevator solves the problem of lifting cargo, it does not address sending it elsewhere. For the station, this would mean an increased cargo flow and the ability to focus entirely on interplanetary launches, for which it is structurally designed.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX №1. TRUSS. SUPPORTING STRUCTURE</h2>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>The 3×3 m profiled tube, hollow inside, with wall thicknesses of 0.604 mm (10g) and 1.21 mm (20g), withstands the load due to the alloy’s strength. Supports and diagonals (cross-section 0.05 m × 0.05 m) add rigidity. The mass with a safety factor (×2) is realistic: 4.27 t for 10g and 8.55 t for 20g, with the difference proportional to the load.</p>

<!-- Appendix 2 -->
<h2>APPENDIX №2. GYROSCOPES</h2>
<p>Imagine a space station at an altitude of 100 kilometers above Earth, moving at an orbital speed of 7.85 kilometers per second (7850 meters per second). The station does not span the entire Earth but occupies a segment about 4-5 thousand kilometers long. Its task is to accelerate a 20-ton (20,000 kg) cart against its motion to a speed of 7.385 kilometers per second (7385 meters per second), allowing the cart to hover over a fixed point on Earth, accounting for Earth’s rotation (465 meters per second at the equator). The cart then moves for 8 minutes (480 seconds) and stops.</p>
<p>The station consists of 200-meter-long blocks, totaling 23,285 blocks, each weighing 30 tons (30,000 kg). When the cart accelerates at 5g (49.05 m/s²), its terrestrial weight at one end of a block causes rotation around the center of mass. Additionally, adjusting the cart’s motion in a magnetic levitation suspension creates uneven loading on the block, amplifying rotation. This is limited by dampers connecting the block to others, but to prevent destructive stresses, rotation must be compensated using gyroscopes. Knowing the cart’s course deviations and control methods via levitation, we can counteract the primary rotation during its passage. Gyroscopes also store electrical energy for the system. Each block has 4 gyroscope groups. This is a preliminary calculation; their number, mass, and position will be refined during detailed design. Here, they are provided to estimate the station’s mass and energy reserves.</p>

<h3>Each Group:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Large gyroscope with triple mass reserve (for energy storage)</li>
    <li>Small (maneuvering) gyroscope with standard mass and 3D suspension (for precise orientation adjustment)</li>
</ul>

<p>Generators control gyroscope rotation, with large and small generators having equal power, without redundancy. We’ll account for the mass of supports and suspensions and calculate the station’s energy in terajoules and gigawatt-hours.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Station Length</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Speed = 7385 m/s</li>
            <li>Acceleration = 49.05 m/s²</li>
            <li>Distance = (7385²) / (2 × 49.05) ≈ 556 km</li>
            <li>Time = 7385 / 49.05 ≈ 150.56 s</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Travel:</strong> 7385 m/s × 480 s = 3544.8 km</li>
    <li><strong>Deceleration:</strong> 556 km</li>
    <li><strong>Total:</strong> 556 + 3544.8 + 556 = 4656.8 km (rounded to 4657 km)</li>
    <li><strong>Blocks:</strong> 4,657,000 m / 200 m = 23,285</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Rotation from Cart Weight</h3>
<p>The cart transfers rotation solely due to its terrestrial weight, not acceleration impulse.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cart weight at 100 km:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>g(h) ≈ 9.22 m/s² (adjusted for gravity reduction)</li>
            <li>Force = 20,000 × 9.22 = 184,400 N</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Force applied at block end (100 m from center of mass):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Torque = 184,400 × 100 = 18,440,000 N·m</li>
            <li>Cart length: 10 m</li>
            <li>Contact time at block end: 10 / 7385 ≈ 0.001354 s</li>
            <li>Angular momentum = 18,440,000 × 0.001354 ≈ 24,966 kg·m²/s</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Block moment of inertia (rod, 30,000 kg, 200 m):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>I = (1/12) × 30,000 × 200² = 100,000,000 kg·m²</li>
            <li>Angular velocity = 24,966 / 100,000,000 ≈ 0.00025 rad/s</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Gyroscopes compensate this rotation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Gyroscopes and Generators</h3>
<h4>Base Gyroscope Mass</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Angular momentum of one gyroscope: 6639.21 kg·m²/s (I = 13.27842 kg·m², ω = 500 rad/s)</li>
    <li>8 gyroscopes: 8 × 6639.21 = 53,113.68 kg·m²/s</li>
    <li>Required angular momentum: 24,966 kg·m²/s</li>
    <li>53,113.68 / 24,966 ≈ 2.13 — sufficient with over double the reserve</li>
</ul>

<h4>Large Gyroscope (Energy Reserve)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Mass = 319 kg (3× base 106.23 kg)</li>
    <li>Moment of inertia = 0.125 × 319 = 39.875 kg·m²</li>
    <li>Energy = 0.5 × 39.875 × 250,000 = 4,984,375 J (4.98 MJ)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Maneuvering Gyroscope</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Mass = 106.23 kg</li>
    <li>Moment of inertia = 13.27875 kg·m²</li>
    <li>Energy = 0.5 × 13.27875 × 250,000 = 1,659,843.75 J (1.66 MJ)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Generators</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Maneuvering:</strong> Power = 1.66 MW / 0.9 ≈ 1.84 MW, Mass = 184 kg</li>
    <li><strong>Large:</strong> Power = 1.84 MW, Mass = 184 kg</li>
    <li>Per group = 368 kg</li>
    <li>4 groups = 1472 kg</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supports and 3D Suspension</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Generator supports: 1472 × 0.15 = 221 kg</li>
    <li>3D suspension (4 maneuvering): 106.23 × 0.25 × 4 = 106 kg</li>
    <li>Total = 327 kg</li>
</ul>

<h4>Total Mass per Block</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Large gyroscopes: 1276 kg</li>
    <li>Maneuvering: 425 kg</li>
    <li>Generators: 1472 kg</li>

<h2>APPENDIX №3. BRAKING COMPENSATION</h2>
<h3>Calculation of Resistance and Braking Compensation for an Orbital Station</h3>
<p>For a station moving at altitudes of 100+ km, the resistance of the side walls plays a key role due to its immense length (6000 km), while the nose fairing’s contribution is minimal. To compensate for atmospheric braking, the station ejects cargo at 20 km/s (compensating orbital speed + Earth’s second cosmic velocity). These launches continuously accelerate the station, neutralizing aerodynamic deceleration.</p>

<h3>Cylinder (Station) Parameters:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 8 meters</li>
    <li><strong>Length:</strong> 6000 km = 6,000,000 meters</li>
    <li><strong>Lateral surface area:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Circumference = π × 8 = 25.133 m</li>
            <li>Area = 25.133 × 6,000,000 = 150,796,447 m² (≈150.8 million m²)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Material:</strong> Titanium foil with a polished tungsten oxide (WO₃) layer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analysis of Polished Tungsten Oxide (WO₃) Behavior in Hypersonic Flow and Braking Compensation</h3>
<h4>1. Choice of Tungsten Oxide (WO₃) and Its Advantages</h4>
<p><strong>Reasons for selection:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>High thermal stability: WO₃ retains structure up to 1200 °C, critical for hypersonic conditions</li>
    <li>Chemical inertness: Resistant to oxidation (already fully oxidized), does not react with N₂</li>
    <li>Mechanical strength: Hardness ~9.5 GPa prevents erosion from particle impacts</li>
    <li>Surface self-healing: Oxygen vacancies (WO₃₋ₓ) quickly fill with atomic O from the flow</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key property:</strong> Atomically smooth surface after ion polishing ensures mirror-like reflection of N₂ and O₂ molecules at small attack angles (<5°).</p>

<h4>2. Interaction with Hypersonic Flow (7.8 km/s)</h4>
<p><strong>Physics of the process:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tangential flow (angle <5°):</strong> Most kinetic energy of molecules is parallel to the surface and not transferred normally.</li>
    <li><strong>Normal component:</strong> Due only to thermal motion of molecules:
        <ul>
            <li>Thermal velocity (v_thermal): ~0.3–0.5 km/s (for N₂/O₂ at 300–500 K)</li>
            <li>Attack angle θ = 5°</li>
            <li>Normal velocity: v_n = v_thermal × sin(5°) ≈ 0.3–0.5 × 0.087 ≈ 26–44 m/s</li>
            <li>Impact energy: E = (1/2) × m × v_n² ≈ 0.001–0.005 eV (for N₂, m ≈ 4.65 × 10⁻²⁶ kg)</li>
            <li>W–O bond energy in WO₃: ~2–3 eV — insufficient for damage</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Polishing effect:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Weakly adsorbed molecules (N₂/O₂) "scrape" residual irregularities</li>
            <li>Atomic O from the flow fills oxygen vacancies, restoring WO₃ stoichiometry</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Accommodation Coefficient (σ)</h4>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> σ = (E_i - E_w) / (E_i - E_r), where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>E_i — incident molecule energy</li>
    <li>E_r — reflected molecule energy</li>
    <li>E_w — energy corresponding to wall temperature</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculated values (for polished WO₃ surface):</strong></p>
<table border="1" style="color: white;">
    <tr><th>Gas / Altitude</th><th>100 km (O₂)</th><th>110 km (O₂/O)</th><th>120 km (30% O)</th></tr>

    <tr><td>σ (O₂)</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>σ (O)</td><td>—</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.4</td></tr>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>N₂: σ = 0 (mirror reflection, minimal energy transfer)</li>
    <li>O₂: σ = 0.1 (weak adsorption on surface defects)</li>
    <li>O: σ = 0.3–0.4 (chemisorption filling vacancies, higher due to WO₃ interaction)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Average σ (considering atmosphere composition):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>100 km: ~90% O₂, 10% N₂ → σ_avg ≈ 0.09</li>
    <li>110 km: ~50% O₂, 40% O, 10% N₂ → σ_avg ≈ 0.17</li>
    <li>120 km: ~30% O, 60% N₂, 10% O₂ → σ_avg ≈ 0.13</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Drag Force and Mass Flow</h4>
<p><strong>Drag force formula (free-molecular regime):</strong> F = (1/2) × ρ × v² × C_d × A, where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ρ — atmospheric density</li>
    <li>v = 7.8 km/s = 7800 m/s</li>
    <li>C_d = 2 × σ (for tangential flow in free-molecular regime)</li>
    <li>A = 150,796,447 m² (lateral surface area)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Daily mass flow:</strong> m = (F × t) / u, where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>t = 86,400 s (day)</li>
    <li>u = 20 km/s = 20,000 m/s (cargo ejection speed)</li>

<h4>5. Key Conclusions</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>WO₃ surface:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Undamaged by hypersonic flow at angles <5°</li>
            <li>Atomic O polishes the surface and restores oxygen vacancies</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Braking:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Lowest at 120 km (258 t/day) due to low atmospheric density and dominant N₂ (σ = 0) with minimal O (σ = 0.4)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Optimal altitude:</strong> 120 km — minimal mass expenditure (258 t/day) and no surface erosion</li>
</ol>

<h3>Verification</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Density: Values refined using the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model for 100–120 km</li>
    <li>Numbers: Intermediate calculations verified, results rounded to whole tons for convenience</li>
</ol>
<p>If further clarification (e.g., fairing contribution or other altitudes) is needed, let me know!</p>
<p>Previous calculations show we can lift at least 2 × 8 tons per orbit (16 orbits/day), yielding 256 tons/day, matching operation at 120 km. Additionally, zero-speed launches relative to Earth’s surface are possible, crucial for raw material supply (rare metals).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The text calculates for 6000 km, though recent estimates suggest 4800–5000 km. This accounts for elongation during launches and the need to shield joints from gas flow.</p>

<!-- Appendix 4 -->
<h2>APPENDIX №4. DAMPERS</h2>
<p>Blocks connected via dampers will average their mutual speed, and elongation between them will stop before the damper reaches its 100-meter physical limit. Note that 100 meters is excessive, potentially by an order of magnitude. However, damper jamming on adjacent blocks, control delays, and the need for maximum visibility are considerations. These are design-specific issues. For understanding the system, damper length is less critical than their ability to convert 90% of the impulse into energy.</p>

<h3>Conditions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mass per block:</strong> 30 tons (30,000 kg)</li>
    <li><strong>Dampers:</strong> Electromagnetic, max length 100 meters, 90% efficiency (90% energy converted to electricity, 10% transferred to the next block)</li>
    <li><strong>Cart:</strong> 20 tons, accelerates from 1 km/s to 7.3 km/s, transferring impulse to blocks</li>
    <li><strong>Initial block speed from cart:</strong> 1.41 m/s (start) to 0.095 m/s (end)</li>
    <li>Blocks linked by dampers averaging their mutual speed</li>
</ul>

<h3>How It Works:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cart passes block i, imparting, e.g., 1.41 m/s leftward.</li>
    <li>Block i+1 remains stationary (or slower).</li>
    <li>Damper stretches, slowing block i and transferring some impulse to block i+1.</li>
    <li>Over time, block speeds equalize, stopping damper stretch before 100 meters.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Block i: Speed 1.41 m/s left</li>
    <li>Block i+1: Speed 0 m/s (before cart arrival)</li>
    <li>Relative speed: 1.41 - 0 = 1.41 m/s</li>
</ul>

<h3>Damper Operation:</h3>
<p>Damper slows block i and accelerates block i+1:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial impulse of block i: 30,000 × 1.41 = 42,300 kg·m/s</li>
    <li>If masses combined, shared speed: 42,300 / (30,000 + 30,000) = 0.705 m/s</li>
    <li>With 90% efficiency:
        <ul>
            <li>Energy of block i: 0.5 × 30,000 × 1.41² = 29,836.5 J</li>
            <li>90% dissipated: 0.9 × 29,836.5 = 26,852.85 J</li>
            <li>10% transferred to block i+1: 0.1 × 29,836.5 = 2983.65 J</li>
            <li>Speed of block i+1: sqrt((2 × 2983.65) / 30,000) ≈ 0.446 m/s</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>After:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Speed of block i: 1.41 - (1.41 - 0.446) = 0.446 m/s (remainder)</li>
            <li>Speed of block i+1: 0.446 m/s</li>
            <li>New relative speed: 1.41 - 0.446 = 0.964 m/s</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Maximum Distance:</h3>
<p>Damper reduces relative speed to 0, but stretch stops when speeds equalize.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial relative speed: 1.41 m/s</li>
    <li>Final (averaged): 0.705 m/s</li>
    <li>Deceleration (approx. for 100 m): 1.41² / (2 × 100) = 0.00995 m/s²</li>
    <li>Damper force: 30,000 × 0.00995 ≈ 298.5 N</li>
    <li><strong>Distance where speeds equalize:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy difference: 0.5 × 30,000 × (1.41² - 0.705²) = 14,918.25 J</li>
            <li>Damper work: F × s = 14,918.25</li>
            <li>s = 14,918.25 / 298.5 ≈ 50 meters</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>With impulse transfer:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Relative speed drops from 1.41 to 0.964 m/s quickly (cart reaches i+1 in 0.05 s)</li>
            <li>Full equalization: s = (1.41² - 0.705²) / (2 × 0.00995) ≈ 75 meters</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Result:</h3>
<p>Maximum distance between adjacent blocks when speeds equalize is ~75 meters, less than 100 meters, as the damper dissipates 90% of energy, stopping blocks relative to each other before the physical limit.</p>
<p><strong>For max speed difference (up to 3 m/s):</strong> s = (3² - 1.5²) / (2 × 0.045) ≈ 75 meters (higher deceleration, same order).</p>

<h2>APPENDIX №5. ORBIT</h2>
<p>If the tunnel is on an orbit with a constant speed of 7.8 km/s, and for a short time Δt = 0.027 s an additional force F = 490,500 N acts toward Earth, it will cause a slight orbit change.</p>

<h3>1. Impact on Center of Mass Motion</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Applied force F creates impulse (system momentum change):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Δp = F × Δt = 490,500 × 0.027 ≈ 13,244 kg·m/s</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Total system mass (tunnel + cargo) m = 30,000 kg:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Center of mass speed change: Δv_cm = Δp / m = 13,244 / 30,000 ≈ 0.44 m/s</li>
            <li>→ Minor braking of orbital motion</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Impact on Orbit Shape</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>If force is strictly toward Earth (perpendicular to speed):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Orbit slightly deforms, becoming more elliptical</li>
            <li>Perigee (closest point to Earth) lowers</li>
            <li>Apogee (farthest point) remains nearly unchanged</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>If slight component along velocity (e.g., due to orientation error):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Possible orbit drift (gradual altitude change)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Practical Significance</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For Δv ~ 0.44 m/s on a 7.8 km/s circular orbit, the change is very small</li>
    <li>Frequent repetition could gradually degrade the orbit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>A brief 490,500 N force over 0.027 s causes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Center of mass speed change of ~0.44 m/s (minimal)</li>
    <li>Slight orbit deformation (if strictly radial)</li>
    <li>No catastrophic effects from a single pass</li>
</ul>
<p>If repeated frequently (e.g., with each cargo pass), the orbit could significantly change over time.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX №6. DRIFT. WIND, LATERAL, AND LONGITUDINAL DRIFT OF CARGO DURING DESCENT</h2>

<h3>Wind Drift</h3>
<h4>Calculation of Wind Drift of Cable and Cargo with Cumulative Wind Impact</h4>
<p>In our system, a cable connects an orbital station at 100 km to a cargo descending to 10 km at 500 m/s, where it’s immediately received by an airship. As the cargo descends, wind pushes the cable and cargo sideways across all altitudes, causing wind drift — deviation from vertical. Wind affects not just the cargo’s current altitude but the entire cable above it, with exposure time increasing for upper sections as descent progresses, amplifying drift speed and total displacement. We’ll divide the cable into 10-km segments, calculate wind force on each, account for exposure time, and determine the cargo’s lateral displacement by the time it reaches 10 km. "Sail area" — the wind’s ability to push the cable and cargo based on shape and area — is a key factor.</p>
<p>The 90-km cable (100 km to 10 km) weighs 7 tons, made of Dyneema SK99, with an 8-ton cargo descending in 180 seconds (90 km ÷ 500 m/s = 180 s). Each 10-km segment takes 20 seconds (10,000 m ÷ 500 m/s = 20 s). Wind varies with altitude: denser air below has weaker winds, while higher altitudes have stronger winds. Forces on upper segments accumulate over time, increasing drift beyond a single-altitude estimate.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Descent Time and Altitudes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Total cable length: 90 km (100 km – 10 km)</li>
    <li>Descent speed: 500 m/s</li>
    <li>Descent time: 90,000 m ÷ 500 m/s = 180 s</li>
    <li>Segments: 9 × 10 km (100–90 km, 90–80 km, ..., 20–10 km)</li>
    <li>Time per segment: 20 s</li>
    <li>Accumulation: 100–90 km acts for 180 s, 90–80 km for 160 s, ..., 20–10 km for 20 s</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Wind Force on Cable and Cargo</h4>
<p><strong>Wind force depends on air density, wind speed, and object area. Formula:</strong> F = 0.5 × ρ × v² × S × Cd, where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>F — wind force (N), how strongly wind pushes</li>
    <li>ρ — air density (kg/m³), mass of air per cubic meter at given altitude</li>
    <li>v — wind speed (m/s)</li>
    <li>S — cross-sectional area (m²), "profile" facing the wind</li>
    <li>Cd — drag coefficient (Cd = 1 for cable and cargo)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cable Segments (per 10 km)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Area (S):</strong> Diameter 9.6 mm (0.0096 m). Per 1 m: S = 0.0096 × 1 = 0.000096 m². Per 10 km: S = 0.000096 × 10,000 = 0.96 m²</li>
    <li><strong>Data by altitude:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>100–90 km: ρ = 0.0000005 kg/m³ (0.5 µg/m³), v = 300 m/s, t = 180 s</li>
            <li>90–80 km: ρ = 0.000001 kg/m³ (1 µg/m³), v = 300 m/s, t = 160 s</li>
            <li>80–70 km: ρ = 0.000002 kg/m³ (2 µg/m³), v = 250 m/s, t = 140 s</li>
            <li>70–60 km: ρ = 0.000004 kg/m³ (4 µg/m³), v = 200 m/s, t = 120 s</li>
            <li>60–50 km: ρ = 0.000008 kg/m³ (8 µg/m³), v = 150 m/s, t = 100 s</li>

<h4>Conclusions:</h4>
<p>Over 180 seconds descending from 100 km to 10 km at 500 m/s, the cable and cargo drift laterally by 1.81 meters. Wind acts simultaneously across all altitudes, accumulating: upper segments (e.g., 100–90 km) push for 180 seconds, lower ones (20–10 km) for 20 seconds. Despite this, drift is small due to thin air above 10 km and low cable sail area. At 10 km, the cargo transfers to an airship, and a 1.81 m drift is easily managed by its maneuverability, as noted elsewhere. The station at 100 km remains fixed, and minimal drift confirms system stability against wind loads.</p>

<h3>Longitudinal Drift</h3>
<h4>Maintaining Cart Speed Stability with Hyperloop Precision in Vacuum</h4>
<p>Our cart travels along a tunnel suspended by a cable from an orbital station at 7385 m/s to deliver cargo to an airship at 10 km. Cable descent takes 180 seconds (90 km ÷ 500 m/s), and we must maintain this speed with high precision. Using Hyperloop parameters — vacuum transport with 1 kHz control frequency and 0.1% current accuracy — we’ll apply them to our cart in a near-perfect vacuum (10⁻⁴ Pa) to see if we can hold 7385 m/s with their precision level, where air resistance is negligible.</p>
<p>The 20-ton cart moves at 7385 m/s in a tunnel with almost no air. Hyperloop achieves 1200 km/h (333 m/s) in low-pressure tubes using magnetic levitation, maintaining ±0.5 m/s precision. Our speed is 22× higher, requiring ±1 m/s over 180 seconds. Vacuum eliminates air drag, but Hyperloop control precision may limit us.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Air Resistance in Vacuum</h4>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> F = 0.5 × ρ × v² × S × Cd, where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>F — drag force (N)</li>
    <li>ρ — air density (kg/m³)</li>
    <li>v — cart speed (m/s)</li>
    <li>S — cross-sectional area (m²)</li>
    <li>Cd — drag coefficient (Cd = 1)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hyperloop:</strong> Pressure 100 Pa (ρ ≈ 0.0012 kg/m³), v = 333 m/s, S ≈ 5 m²:
        <ul>
            <li>F = 0.5 × 0.0012 × 333² × 5 × 1 ≈ 333 N</li>
            <li>Mass 20,000 kg → a = 0.0167 m/s² → loss 0.0167 m/s per second</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Our cart:</strong> Pressure 10⁻⁴ Pa (ρ ≈ 10⁻⁶ kg/m³), v = 7385 m/s, S ≈ 0.5 m²:
        <ul>
            <li>F = 0.5 × 10⁻⁶ × 7385² × 0.5 × 1 ≈ 13.6 N</li>
            <li>Mass 20,000 kg → a = 0.00068 m/s² → loss 0.12 m/s over 180 s</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Vacuum reduces resistance to 0.12 m/s loss, compensable.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Speed Control with Hyperloop Precision</h4>
<p><strong>Magnet force formula:</strong> F = m × a</p>
<ul>
    <li>Correction ±1 m/s: Change 1 m/s in 1 s → a = 1 m/s²</li>
    <li>F = 20,000 × 1 = 20,000 N</li>
    <li>Full acceleration (5g): F_max = 20,000 × 49.05 ≈ 981,000 N</li>
    <li><strong>Hyperloop current precision (0.1%):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Force error = 981,000 × 0.001 = 981 N</li>
            <li>Acceleration error = 981 / 20,000 ≈ 0.049 m/s²</li>
            <li>Speed error per second = 0.049 m/s</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Hyperloop frequency (1 kHz):</strong> 180,000 cycles in 180 s
        <ul>
            <li>Distance per cycle: 7385 × 0.001 = 7.385 m</li>
            <li>Sensor precision: ±0.01 m/s per cycle at 333 m/s → ±0.01 × (7385 / 333) ≈ ±0.22 m/s per cycle</li>
            <li>Total error: ±0.22 m/s (sensors) + ±0.049 m/s (current) ≈ ±0.27 m/s per cycle</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Error accumulation:</strong> Without perfect feedback, current error sums to ±0.049 m/s² × 180 s = ±8.82 m/s, but Hyperloop corrects per cycle, limiting to ±0.27 m/s</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Final Precision</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Control:</strong> 0.1% current and 1 kHz sensors → ±0.27 m/s per cycle</li>
    <li><strong>Over 180 s:</strong> With ideal correction, error stays low, but realistically ±0.5 m/s (Hyperloop level), scaling to ±1.5 m/s at our speed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusions:</h4>
<p>With Hyperloop precision (1 kHz, 0.1% current) in near-vacuum, 7385 m/s is maintained with ±1.5 m/s error over 180 seconds. Vacuum minimizes drag, but sensor (±0.22 m/s) and current (±0.049 m/s) errors sum to ±0.27 m/s per cycle, potentially reaching ±1.5 m/s due to high speed. A 1.5 m/s change causes ±1.5 m longitudinal shift, negligible.</p>

<h3>Lateral Drift</h3>
<h4>Lateral Drift of Cart Due to 0.01-Degree Horizontal Station Bend</h4>
<p>Assuming some or all blocks have GPS, errors may be meters, not tens. But if the station drifts laterally at 0.01 degrees, we’ll calculate the effect.</p>
<p>The station moves on a 100-km circular orbit at ~7800 m/s, held by Earth’s gravity. A 90-km cable descends from 100 km to 10 km in 120 seconds (90 km ÷ 750 m/s), with the cart moving along it at 7385 m/s to reach an airship. In 120 seconds, the station travels ~936 km (7800 m/s × 120 s) along its orbit. A 0.01-degree horizontal bend shifts it laterally from its path. The cable hangs vertically under gravity, but station drift moves its attachment point, causing lateral cart drift relative to Earth.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Station Lateral Speed Due to Bend</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Bend angle: 0.01 degrees = 0.01 × π / 180 ≈ 0.0001745 rad</li>
    <li>Orbital speed: 7800 m/s</li>
    <li>Lateral speed: v_side_station = 7800 × sin(0.0001745) ≈ 1.36 m/s</li>
    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 0.01-degree bend gives 1.36 m/s lateral speed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Station Displacement Over 120 Seconds</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Displacement: Δx_station = 1.36 × 120 ≈ 163.2 m (163 m)</li>
    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Station shifts 163 m laterally</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Cart Lateral Drift</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Cart speed: 7385 m/s vertically along cable</li>
    <li>Lateral drift: Cable tied to station, cart follows attachment point:
        <ul>
            <li>Δx_telezhka = 1.36 × 120 ≈ 163.2 m (163 m)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 4: Real Scenario</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Cart trajectory: Vertical relative to station, but station moves forward (7800 m/s) and laterally (1.36 m/s). Cart drifts 163 m relative to Earth</li>
    <li>Correction: Without air adjustment, drift is fixed; with correction, it may lessen</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusions:</h4>
<p>A 0.01-degree horizontal bend causes the station to drift laterally at 1.36 m/s. Over 120 seconds, it shifts 163 m, and the cart, moving at 7385 m/s along the cable, drifts 163 m relative to Earth. This is noticeable but small compared to the 936-km orbital path. The airship at 10 km can adjust for 163 m drift with sufficient maneuverability, as noted elsewhere. GPS positioning likely reduces this scenario’s likelihood.</p>
